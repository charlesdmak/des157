      <h2>How will your users understand the content of the project?</h2>
      <p>My users will understand the content through clearly labeled subsections. Each major piece of information will be held in its own block and the information will not be overbearing. Each piece of information will be well organized and concise.</p>

      <h2>How will your users understand the primary objectives?<h2>
      <p>The users will be guided through the projects by various subsections while scrolling through the website.</p>

      <h2>What content and features do your users need, and in what form do they need it?</h2>
      <p>Users will need engaging information. I will attempt to achieve this through many visuals and animations. There must be an easy way to navigate between sections as well.</p>

      <h2>How do your users think your interactive projects should work and what are their experience levels with the type of media you are creating?</h2>
      <p>All users should have an easy time with this project because I plan on having it as a single website with various aspects and information come up as the page is scrolled through. The project will combine storytelling and history to persuade the audience to see a new perspective.</p>

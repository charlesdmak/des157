    <h1>"Drugs are bad"</h1>
    <h3>is what we've grown up believing...</h3>
    <article class="height100 textBlock">
      <p>The war on drugs in the United States can be traced back to the 60’s where recreational drug use, which included substances like cocaine, marijuana, and LSD, was finding its way into the youth demographics. This resulting in part due to a rising rebellious sentiment created from social unrest. Legislation began in the 70s under President Nixon to focus on reducing drug abuse, declaring that drug abuse was “public enemy number one”. The next wave of legislation came under the Reagan era, in which a new smokable form of cocaine -- crack -- rose in popularity in areas like New York and Los Angeles. Consequently, levels of arrests and incarcerations continued to rise and prisons were continuing to fill with those who possessed and sold crack cocaine.</p>

    <h1>Take a look at this</h1>
    <h3>and ask yourself what was really accomplished...</h3>
    <article class="height100 textBlock">
      <p>Drug policy in the 70s resulted in the incarceration of individuals from certain communities, as it targeted users of marijuana. In 1972, President Nixon’s commission unanimously voted to decriminalize marijuana, but Nixon rejected the recommendations and continued to pursue those found possessing and distributing marijuana. Why? <br><br>
      During President Reagan's era, a new smokable form of cocaine -- crack -- rose in popularity in areas like New York and Los Angeles. Crack, as opposed to its molecularly identical predecessor, was associated with poorer, margianilized populations. Moreover, charges associated with crack were vastly more severe than those associated with cocaine. As a result, the levels of arrests and incarcerations continued to rise and prisons were continuing to fill up.</p>

      It will include stats, demographics, charts. I want to show the effects of the drug war on the marginalized groups through numbers.</p>

    <h1>Change starts with us</h1>
    <h3>and we can't stop until we have the truth...</h3>
    <article class="height100 textBlock">
      <p>Today, drug policy is taking a more sensible approach. States have decriminalized marijuana and are looking to pursue lesser sentences on other drugs. The hope is for more sensible drug policies to be enacted to reduce harsh punishments behind what seems to be small charges. ...more call to action here...</p>

        <h2>Spotify Interface</h2>
            <img src="images/spotify.jpg" alt="interface">
              <p>Spotify has become one of the biggest streaming services on the market by creating a streamlined and intuitive interface that engages its users through interactive modules and ease of browsing. It has two main areas for navigation - one that organizes your saved music and playlists, while the other serves as a search area. The "landing page" is a page that let's you browse through various genres, artists, and playlists that Spotify generates for you based on your listening preferences. One aspect that makes Spotify's interface stand out is it's "back" function. It saves the pages that you previously have browsed and allows you to seemlessly switch back and forth between different tracks, albums, artists, and more.</p>
